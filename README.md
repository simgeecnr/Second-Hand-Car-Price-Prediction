# Second-Hand Car Price Prediction

 This repository contains the code and resources for a second hand car price prediction project developed as part of the CS464 course. The aim of this project is to predict the prices of second hand cars based on various features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and other relevant factors. The algorithms used are as follows:

 - Linear Regression
 - Lasso and Ridge Regression
 - Elastic Net
 - Random Forest Regression
 - Support Vector Regression
 - Neural Network
